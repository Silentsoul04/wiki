## Tapping code

Tap code is a way to encode text information in a very simple way. Because the code is named after the information is
encoded by using a series of click sounds, the hit code is based on a 5 Ã— 5 square Polibiz array, the difference is that
the K letter is integrated into C.

|Tap Code|1    |2    |3    |4    |5    |
|:------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|1       |A    |B    |C/K  |D    |E    |
|2       |F    |G    |H    |I    |J    |
|3       |L    |M    |N    |O    |P    |
|4       |Q    |R    |S    |T    |U    |
