# Horde CTF Wiki

Welcome to **Horde CTF Wiki**ÔºÅ

**CTF** (Capture The Flag) started from **DEFCON CTF**, a competitive game among computer security enthusiasts,
originally hosted in 1996.

**CTF** covers a wide range of fields. Along with the evolving security technology, the difficulty of **CTF** challenges
is getting harder and harder. As a result, the learning curve for beginners is getting steeper. Most online information
is scattered and trivial. Beginners often don't know how to systematically learn **CTF**, which requires a lot of work
and effort.

As a freedom site, primarily focusing on recent **CTF**s, **Horde CTF Wiki** introduces the knowledge and techniques in
all aspects of **CTF** to make it easier for beginners to learn **CTF**.

Now, **Horde CTF Wiki** mainly contains the basic skill-set for **CTF**, but we are working hard to improve the
following contents.

- Advanced skills used in CTF
- Special topics appearing in CTF

Although now **Horde CTF Wiki** mainly focus **CTF**, it is not strictly limited to **CTF** topics. In the future, **
Horde CTF Wiki** will include:

- Tools used in security research
- Increased discussion of security in the world
